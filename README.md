# 🐍 Snake Game – Python + Turtle

A clean and fully working version of the classic Snake Game — built from scratch using Python’s Turtle module.  
Simple, fun, and a cool way to sharpen my logic and event-handling skills.

## 🎮 What It Does
- Real-time snake movement with keyboard controls
- Score tracking and display updates
- Game over detection on collision
- Smooth visuals using Turtle graphics

## 🧠 Why I Built This
I wanted a mini project to test my Python fundamentals and explore how basic games work under the hood.  
This helped me understand concepts like loops, collision detection, and input handling — all while having fun coding it.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3** – core programming language  
- **Turtle** – for 2D graphics and rendering  
- **OOP Basics** – structured code using classes  
- **Event Handling** – keyboard inputs (`onkey`)  
- **Game Logic** – conditions, loops, functions
